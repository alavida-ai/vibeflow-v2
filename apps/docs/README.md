# Vibeflow Documentation

Welcome to Vibeflow - the AI-powered marketing framework that transforms how marketing agencies operate and scale.

## What is Vibeflow?

Vibeflow is an AI agent orchestration system designed specifically for marketing professionals. Think of it as your intelligent project manager that coordinates specialized AI agents to execute your marketing workflows, while always staying aligned with your brand strategy.

### The Three-Tier System

Vibeflow operates on a **Shopify-like model** with three distinct roles:

#### üéØ **End Users** (Your Clients)
The people who use Vibeflow daily to create content. They simply ask Claude to "write a blog post" or "create social media content" and get brand-aligned results instantly.
- **Who**: Marketing managers, content creators, business owners
- **What they do**: Request content creation through natural conversation
- **What they don't do**: Configure systems, manage strategy, or worry about technical setup

#### üèóÔ∏è **Marketing Architects** (Agency Owners like Thomas)
The strategic layer who configure Vibeflow for each client. They set up brand strategy, workflows, and ensure quality control.
- **Who**: Agency owners, marketing consultants, brand strategists  
- **What they do**: Configure brand bibles, create workflows, manage client relationships
- **What they don't do**: Build technical integrations or develop new platform features

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Content Engineers** (Platform Developers)
The technical infrastructure team who build and maintain the Vibeflow platform capabilities.
- **Who**: Software developers, AI engineers, platform team
- **What they do**: Build agents, create tools, develop integrations
- **What they don't do**: Manage client relationships or create marketing strategy

### Why This Structure Works

- **End Users** get instant, brand-aligned content without learning complex systems
- **Marketing Architects** maintain strategic control while automating execution  
- **Content Engineers** focus on building powerful capabilities, not managing clients

## Quick Start

### For Marketing Architects
```bash
npx create-vibeflow-app@latest my-agency
cd my-agency
```

### For End Users
Your Marketing Architect will provide you with access. Then you simply chat with Claude to create content.
