# System Architecture

Understanding how Vibeflow works under the hood will help you make better decisions about workflows, agents, and client strategy. Don't worry - we'll explain everything in marketing terms, not technical jargon.

## The Big Picture

Think of Vibeflow as your marketing agency's nervous system. It connects your strategic brain (the brand bible) to specialized team members (agents) who execute tasks, all coordinated by an intelligent project manager (the Cursor Agent).

## Core Components Explained

### The AI Project Manager (Your Digital Campaign Manager)

The **Cursor Agent** is like hiring the world's best campaign manager who:

- **Never forgets your brand guidelines** - Always references your brand bible before making decisions
- **Coordinates your team perfectly** - Knows which specialist to assign to each task
- **Asks the right questions** - When information is missing, asks you instead of guessing
- **Maintains quality control** - Reviews all work against your acceptance criteria
- **Learns from feedback** - Incorporates your input to improve future performance

**What this means for you:**
You get consistent, brand-aligned work without micromanaging every detail. The AI handles coordination while you focus on strategy and client relationships.

### Your Brand Bible (The Strategic Foundation)

Your `strategy/` folder contains markdown files that serve as your brand's constitution. Every AI decision flows from these documents.

**Why this matters:**
- **Consistency**: All content sounds like it comes from the same brand voice
- **Scalability**: New team members (human or AI) instantly understand your brand
- **Quality**: No more off-brand content slipping through
- **Efficiency**: Less time explaining brand guidelines repeatedly

**Example Structure:**
```
strategy/
â”œâ”€â”€ brand-positioning.md    # Who you are, what you stand for
â”œâ”€â”€ target-audience.md      # Who you're talking to
â”œâ”€â”€ voice-messaging.md      # How you communicate
â”œâ”€â”€ content-pillars.md      # What topics you focus on
â”œâ”€â”€ campaign-calendar.md    # Seasonal and recurring themes
â””â”€â”€ competitor-landscape.md # Market positioning context
```

### Workflows (Your Marketing Playbooks)

Workflows transform your marketing processes into step-by-step instructions that AI can execute consistently.

**Think of workflows like:**
- **Recipes** - Specific ingredients and steps for repeatable results
- **Playbooks** - Proven processes that work every time
- **Standard Operating Procedures** - How your agency does things

**Workflow Components:**

1. **Steps** - Individual tasks in sequence
2. **Instructions** - Clear direction for the AI project manager
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - How to know if the step is complete
4. **Agent References** - Which specialists to use

```yaml
# Example: Content Creation Workflow
name: "Blog Post Creation"
description: "Create SEO-optimized blog posts aligned with brand voice"

steps:
  - name: "Research Phase"
    instructions: "Research the topic and identify key trends"
    acceptance_criteria: "Three credible sources and trend analysis"
    agents: ["research-agent"]
    
  - name: "Content Creation"
    instructions: "Write blog post using research and brand guidelines"
    acceptance_criteria: "1500 words, SEO optimized, on-brand voice"
    agents: ["content-agent"]
```

### Decision-Making Framework

The AI Project Manager follows a strict decision-making process:

1. **Consult Brand Bible First** - Every decision starts with your strategy documents
2. **Check for Missing Information** - If context is unclear, ask you instead of guessing
3. **Select Right Specialists** - Choose agents based on task requirements
4. **Provide Rich Context** - Brief agents with comprehensive brand information
5. **Quality Control** - Review outputs against acceptance criteria
6. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Incorporate your input to improve results

### Multi-Client Architecture

For agencies managing multiple clients, each client gets their own isolated environment:

```
your-agency-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ client-tech-startup/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/           # Tech startup brand bible
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/          # SaaS-focused workflows
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ outputs/           # Generated content
â”œâ”€â”€ client-ecommerce/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/           # E-commerce brand bible
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/          # Retail-focused workflows
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ outputs/           # Generated content
â””â”€â”€ agency-internal/
    â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/           # Your agency's brand
    â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/          # Business development workflows
    â””â”€â”€ outputs/           # Your own marketing content
```

**Benefits:**
