## Core Concepts

### 1. The Brand Bible (Your Strategic Foundation)

The `strategy/` folder contains markdown files that define your brand's voice, positioning, and approach. This is your **single source of truth** that guides every AI decision.

**Example: brand-positioning.md**
```markdown
# Brand Positioning

## Mission
We help B2B SaaS companies scale through authentic storytelling.

## Value Proposition
Transform complex technical features into compelling customer narratives.

## Tone of Voice
- Professional but approachable
- Data-driven yet human
- Confident without being arrogant
```

### 2. Workflows (Your Marketing Processes)

Workflows break down complex marketing goals into step-by-step instructions. Each step has:
- Clear instructions for the AI project manager
- Specific acceptance criteria
- References to required tools/agents

### 3. Agents (Your Specialized Team)

Agents are AI specialists with access to specific tools:
- **Research Agent**: Market analysis, competitor research, trend identification
- **Content Agent**: Writing, editing, SEO optimization
- **Analytics Agent**: Performance tracking, report generation
- **Social Agent**: Platform management, posting, engagement

## Client Project Structure

For agencies managing multiple clients, create separate Vibeflow instances:

```
your-agency/
â”œâ”€â”€ client-a/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ client-b/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agents/
â””â”€â”€ your-agency/
    â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/
    â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/
    â””â”€â”€ agents/
```

Each client gets their own:
- Brand bible tailored to their business
- Custom workflows for their goals
- Agent configurations for their needs

## Your First Workflow

Let's run a simple content creation workflow:

1. **Open your AI assistant** (Cursor)
2. **Navigate to your Vibeflow directory**
3. **Say**: "List available workflows"
4. **Choose**: "content-creation" workflow
5. **Follow the prompts** as the AI guides you through each step

The AI will:
- Consult your brand bible for context
- Coordinate with specialized agents
- Ask you questions when input is needed
- Present results that align with your brand

## What Happens Next?

The AI project manager will:
- Read your brand positioning and voice guidelines
- Delegate research tasks to the Research Agent
- Brief the Content Agent with brand-specific context
- Present you with brand-aligned content drafts
- Iterate based on your feedback
