## Project Structure

## Working with Workflows

You have access to the Vibeflow MCP server which provides tools for:

- Starting workflow execution
- Managing workflow steps and state
- Collaborating with AI agents

## Best Practices

- Define workflows in YAML format with clear steps, prompts, and acceptance criteria [[memory:8124231]]
- Start with acceptance criteria and prompts rather than overcomplicating specs [[memory:8112054]]  
- Use the MCP tools to interact with workflows programmatically
- Follow the existing project structure and naming conventions

## Key Commands

- Use MCP tools to list workflows: `list-workflows`
- Start workflows with: `start-workflow`
- Navigate workflow steps with: `next-step`

Always consult the Vibeflow MCP when working with workflows and agent collaboration.
